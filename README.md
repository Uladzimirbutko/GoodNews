# GoodNews
This is my first project based on ASP.NETcore5 and WebApi. which reflects my skills acquired during training in IT-Academy courses.
This project implements news aggregation using RSS feeds and storing text in the database using HTML AGILITY PACK. Also, a system of authorization and user authentication on the site is implemented using roles and registration data.
Error handling and logging using Serilog is used.
Working with the database is implemented using the Generic Repository and UnitOfWork in the MVC project  and CQS + MediatR in the Web Api part.
Web Api part is executed in REST architectural style. Authorization and authentication is done using JWT.
The project was carried out based on the principles of SOLID, KISS, DRY.
